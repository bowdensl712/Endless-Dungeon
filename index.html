<!-- Goals-
    General-
        -Append and customize HTML elements using JavaScript.
        -Randomly generate enemies as the player moves forward
        -Stop forward movement until the current enemy is defeated
        -If the enemy drops the player's HP to 0, Game over.

        Combat-
        -Use attack/defense multipliers to change damage inflicted.
        -If an enemy is defeated on a turn, stop them from attacking for that turn.

        Inventory Management-
        -Enemies drop loot, such as weapons, armor, healing items, etc.
        -Player can open an inventory menu at any time, without disturbing their spot in the story.

    Randomized rooms-
        -Randomly generate mutliple room types
        -The same room type persists for a random number of rooms (not changing each time)
        -Each room type has its own randomly generated description.
        -Enemy types and loot vary based on room type.

<!-- Devlog (Probels and Solutions)
    Problem: Since copied array entries are shallow copies, every time currentEnemy took damage, the HP of the base enemy changes.
    Solution: Used JSON.parse(JSON.stringify() to create a deep copy of the array.

    Problem: How to display the inventory text without messing up the current progress in travel/combat?
    Solution: Just hide the container <div> and replace it with another inventory <div>.
